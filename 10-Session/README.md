# Chapter 5 - Binominal Probability Distribution

### Goals for the Review:
+ Identify the characteristics of a probability distribution.
+ Distinguish between discrete and continuous random variables.
+ Compute the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a probability distribution.
+ Explain the assumptions and compute probabilities of the binomial distribution

$$ 
P(x) = \binom{N}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}
$$
