# Chapter 3 - Describing Data - Measures of Position + Review


### Goals for the Review:

+ Compute and interpret the mean, the median and the mode.
+ Identify and compute a weighted mean.
+ Compute and interpret the geometric mean.
+ Determine the median and identify the mode. 
+ Commpute and interpret the range, mean deviation, variance and standard deviation.
+ Explain and apply Chebyshev's theorem and the Empirical Rule.
+ Compute and interpret the coefficient of skewness and the coefficient of variation. 
+ **Identify and compute measures of position.**
+ **Construct and analyse box plots.**
+ **Compute the mean, median, and standard deviation of grouped data**.

### Statistical Application

+ Visualizing the returns of different asset classes are distributed using, histograms, scatterplots and boxplots.
  + We are going to analyse the ETFs: 
    + TIP seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of inflation-protected U.S. Treasury bonds.
    + HYG seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. dollar-denominated, high yield corporate bonds.
    + IVV seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of large-capitalization U.S. equities.
    + EWZ seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of Brazilian equities
