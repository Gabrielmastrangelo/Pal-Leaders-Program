# Chapter 3 - Describing Data â€“ Numerical Measures

### Goals for the chapter:
+ Compute and interpret the mean, the median and the mode.
+ Identify and compute a weighted mean.
+ Compute and interpret the geometric mean.
+ Determine the median and identify the mode. 
+ Compute and interpret the range, mean deviation, variance and standard deviation.
+ Explain and apply Chebyshev's theorem and the Empirical Rule.
+ Compute and interpret the coefficient of skewness and the coefficient of variation. 

### Statistical Application

+ Calculate the geometric mean of the returns from S&P, and it's standard deviation
  + From the geometric mean, we will calculate the Daily, Monthly and Annualized returns, and its standard deviation
+ We will compute the mean of the volume and its standard deviation
+ We will compute the coefficient of variation from both, and them we will compare them

### Materials
