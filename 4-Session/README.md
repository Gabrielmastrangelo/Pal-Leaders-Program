### Goals for the chapter:
+ Compute and interpret the mean, the median and the mode.
+ Identify and compute a weighted mean.
+ Compute and interpret the geometric mean.
+ Determine the median and identify the mode. 
+ Compute and interpret the range, mean deviation, variance and standard deviation.
+ Explain and apply Chebyshev's theorem and the Empirical Rule.
+ Compute and interpret the coefficient of skewness and the coefficient of variation. 

### Statistical Application
