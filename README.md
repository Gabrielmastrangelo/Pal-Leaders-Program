# Pal-Leaders-Program
Pal-Program for the Business Statistics Classes at Capilano University

## About the Program
The PAL program at CapU is a very interesting project, based on Supplemental Instruction (SI).
The “Supplemental Instruction (SI) is a non-traditional form of tutoring that focuses on collaboration, group study, and interaction for assisting students in undertaking "traditionally difficult" courses” - [link](https://www.txstate.edu/slac/suppinst/about.html)
Research has shown that students who regularly attend Supplemental Instruction sessions are more likely to earn higher marks in the course that the Supplemental Instruction supports and in general as compared to students who do not use Supplemental Instruction resources (Burmeister, 2013 and Blanc et al, 1983)

## About the repository
Statistics is about working with data and this repository aims to show some statistical applications in real-world datasets based on the material that is taught in the course.
Hoping that by showing these applications to the students they will become more interested in learning the theoretical background to do so.
