# Review Chapter 5 and 4

### Goals for the Session:
#### Chapter 4
+ Define the terms probability, experiment, event, and outcome. 
+ Assign probabilities using the classical, empirical or subjective probability. 
+ Determine the number of outcomes using principles of counting. 
+ Calculate probabilities using the rules of addition.  
+ Calculate probabilities using the rules of multiplication.  
+ Compute probabilities using a contingency table. 
+ Use a tree diagram to organize and compute probabilities. 
#### Chapter 5
+ Identify the characteristics of a probability distribution. 
+ Distinguish between discrete and continuous random variables. 
+ Compute the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a probability distribution. 
+ Explain the assumptions and compute probabilities of the binomial distribution 
+ Explain the assumptions and compute probabilities of the hypergeometric distribution.  
+ Explain the assumptions and compute probabilities of the Poisson distribution.
